        <h2>My history with game development</h2>
        <p>
          I've been technically been making games since I was 9 on scratch, but who cares about that?<br><br>
          The only other real game I've made was a Pokemon fangame called "Pokemon Redder and Bluer", stupid name I know.<br>
          It was my interpretation as a 14 year old of what a Kanto game would look like 15 years after the events of the original.<br><br>
          I never finished it due to lack of motivation after a while, and it's now basically lost media to anyone but me since the Relic Castle website shut down.<br><br>
          Another game I have attempted to make was something I called "Project BZ". It mostly stayed as a concept, but it was a sci-fi RPG with a focus on action commands. I designed a lot of characters and locations for it, but having no real gamedev experience, the scope was way too high.
        </p>
        <h2>The initial concept for Mira's Journal</h2>
        <p>
          With Project BZ being such a dream project, I wanted to make a more down to earth RPG.<br>
          Of course any kind of RPG is still a huge project, and not what most people would recommend as a beginner game.<br><br>
          It was October of 2021 when I drew the first sketches of some of the character for Mira's Journal.<br><br>
          The first characters I made for this game were Mira, Daze and Alcine.
          <br><br>
          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyMira1.bmp" alt="The first sketch of Mira" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 60%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyMira2.bmp" alt="The first sketch of Mira but colored digitally" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 25%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Mira was a young wolf girl with some fire powers who ends up getting mixed up in Daze's affairs.<br><br>
          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyGame3.bmp" alt="First sketch of Daze and Alcine, along with some UI elements" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 98%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Daze was meant to be a stereotypical hero, the usual leader of the party with a special destiny.<br><br>
          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyAlcine.png" alt="Early sketch of Alcine" style="max-height: 200px; object-fit: scale-down; max-width: 25%;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyAlcineLater.png" alt="Later sketch of Alcine" style="max-height: 200px; object-fit: scale-down; max-width: 20%;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyAlcineLater2.bmp" alt="Sketch of alcine on top of Mira" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 22%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Alcine has changed a lot through development. What's stayed the same is that they're a spirit creature with a liquid body.<br>
          But originally they had a more mature look with something that resembles long hair. But I later decided to make them more like a child originally that grows along the journey.<br><br>
          These are some other early sketches related to the game:<br><br>

          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyGame2.bmp" alt="Sketch of a certain building" style="max-height: 400px; width: 48%; max-width: 300px; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br>
          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyYaru.bmp" alt="First sketch of Yaru" style="max-height: 400px; width: 48%; max-width: 300px; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="media/MJ/EarlyGame4.bmp" alt="Early concept for the main menu + Mira holding a flame" style="max-height: 400px; width: 48%; max-width: 300px; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br>

        <h2>The RPG Maker MZ version of the game</h2>
        <p>
          In early 2022 I bought the RPG Maker MZ engine with the intention of using it to make this game.<br><br> 
          The reason I picked it was simple:<br>
           I wanted to make a top down rpg that I thought was not too complex, and this seemed to be what this engine was designed for.<br><br>
           I worked on this version of the game for about 9 months, with some results.
