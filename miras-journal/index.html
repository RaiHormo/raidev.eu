        <h2>My history with game development</h2>
        <p>
          I've technically been making games since I was 9 on scratch, but who cares about that?<br><br>
          The only other real game I've made was a Pokemon fangame called "Pokemon Redder and Bluer", stupid name I know.<br>
          It was my interpretation as a 14 year old of what a Kanto game would look like 15 years after the events of the original.<br><br>
          I never finished it due to lack of motivation after a while, and it's now basically lost media to anyone but me since the Relic Castle website shut down.<br><br>
          Another game I have attempted to make was something I called "Project BZ". It mostly stayed as a concept, but it was a sci-fi RPG with a focus on action commands. I designed a lot of characters and locations for it, but having no real gamedev experience, the scope was way too high.
        </p>
        <img src="/media/MJ/BZConcept.png" alt="A concept of the game's battle screen, never made it into a real thing." style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 100%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
        <h2>The initial concept for Mira's Journal</h2>
        <p>
          With Project BZ being such a dream project, I wanted to make a more down to earth RPG.<br>
          Of course any kind of RPG is still a huge project, and not what most people would recommend as a beginner game.<br><br>
          It was October of 2021 when I drew the first sketches of some of the character for Mira's Journal.<br><br>
          The first characters I made for this game were Mira, Daze and Alcine.
          <br><br>
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyMira1.bmp" alt="The first sketch of Mira" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 60%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyMira2.bmp" alt="The first sketch of Mira but colored digitally" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 25%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Mira was a young wolf girl with some fire powers who ends up getting mixed up in Daze's affairs.<br><br>
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyGame3.bmp" alt="First sketch of Daze and Alcine, along with some UI elements" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 98%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Daze was meant to be a stereotypical hero, the usual leader of the party with a special destiny.<br><br>
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyAlcine.png" alt="Early sketch of Alcine" style="max-height: 200px; object-fit: scale-down; max-width: 25%;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyAlcineLater.png" alt="Later sketch of Alcine" style="max-height: 200px; object-fit: scale-down; max-width: 20%;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyAlcineLater2.bmp" alt="Sketch of alcine on top of Mira" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 22%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Alcine has changed a lot through development. What's stayed the same is that they're a spirit creature with a liquid body.<br>
          But originally they had a more mature look with something that resembles long hair. But I later decided to make them more like a child originally that grows along the journey.<br><br>
          These are some other early sketches related to the game:<br><br>

        <h2>The RPG Maker MZ version of the game</h2>
        <p>
          In early 2022 I bought the RPG Maker MZ engine with the intention of using it to make this game.<br><br> 
          The reason I picked it was simple:<br>
           I wanted to make a top down rpg that I thought was not too complex, and this seemed to be what this engine was designed for.<br><br>
           I worked on this version of the game for about 9 months, with some results.<br>
           However RPG Maker turned out to be quite limiting for what I wanted to do. <br><br>
           Working on a game on it feels more like modding an existing game rather than creating something new, as the pre-existing systems are designed for a very specific type of battle system. Creating mechanics and especially UI were pretty tedious, and working with plug-ins such as VizuStella was just annoying, so I ended up scrapping that version of the game.
           <br><br>
           Here are some screenshots of this version:
        </p>

        <img src="/media/MJ/RMScreenshot2.png" alt="It's not supposed to be this zoomed out, there is a bug in the latest version of this that was never fixed." style="max-height: 400px; width: 48%; max-width: 300px; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">

        <h2>The Godot version</h2>
        <p>
          After I was done with my entrance exams in the 15th of July 2023, I instantly jumped into this engine I had never used before called Godot.<br><br>
          Why Godot? There are Plenty of reasons.<br><br>
          One was the fact that it was open source, which comes with the usual benefits like being completly free and independent from a company's dumb decisions. <br>
          Open source software also often works great on Linux, which I had started using as my main operating system around that time. Godot had also just released the 4.0 update back then, so it felt like a great chance to jump in.<br><br>
          I had absolutely no programming knowlegde at the time, but I felt like it was a perfect chance to learn. <br><br>
          So I just started working on this game again and I slowly learned how to use most things in the engine. This time I had to implement stuff like saving and inventories myself, which I had taken for granted in RPG Maker, but it's honestly more fun this way.<br><br>
          And that brings us to the present, thanks for reading!

        <h2>When will this be released?</h2>
        <p>I honestly have no idea. Game development is very complicated and I'm currently doing this myself entirely as a hobby. It'll probably take years.<br>
        Maybe some sort of demo release is closer, but don't hold your breath.
      </p>
      <h2>What platforms will it be available on?</h2>
      <p>
        Well the main target during development is Linux and Windows, with it releasing on Steam.<br>
        Mac is probably possible but I would have nothing to test it on. An android release is also something I would want to do after launch, but it would need a seprate UI mode for it to work.<br><br>
        Consoles? I wish I had the budget for that.
