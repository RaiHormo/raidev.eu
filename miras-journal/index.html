        <p>
          This is a game I've been working on as a side-project for a while.

          It's a turn-based RPG, somewhat inspired by ATLUS games.<br>
          It features calendar progression and a color-based battle system.<br></p>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          A young wolf girl named Mira Levenor who finds herself in a strange realm in ruins, with a few people stuck there trying to survive.<br>
          As each day passes the surroundings get more and more corrupted.<br><br>
          Follow her day to day life exploring the lost realm, fighting in turn-based battles and getting to know new people as they try to find a way to the outside world and discover the truth.<br><br>
          During her adventures, Mira will keep a journal, giving her thoughts on everything that happens every day.<br>
          <h2>Current state</h2>
          The game is still in early development, and all the work so far has been done by one person.

      <div id="how-it-started" class="MJ-tab">
        <h2>My history with game development</h2>
        <p>
          I first started making games as a kid with scratch. I never made anything major though, my most notable projects were a Mario fangame I only made 3 levels for and a simple PVP game.<br><br>
          The only other game I've made was a Pokemon fangame called "Pokemon Redder and Bluer", stupid name I know.<br>
          It was my interpretation as a 14 year old of what a Kanto game would look like 15 years after the events of the original.<br><br>
          I never finished it due to lack of motivation after a while, and it's now basically lost media to anyone but me since the Relic Castle website shut down.<br><br>
          Another game I have attempted to make was something I called "Project BZ". It mostly stayed as a concept, but it was a sci-fi RPG with a focus on action commands. I designed a lot of characters and locations for it, but having no real gamedev experience, the scope was way too high.
        </p>
        <img src="/media/MJ/BZConcept.png" alt="A concept of the game's battle screen, never made it into a real thing." style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 100%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
        <h2>The initial concept for Mira's Journal</h2>
        <p>
          With Project BZ being such a dream project, I wanted to make a more down to earth RPG.<br>
          Of course any kind of RPG is still a huge project, and not what most people would recommend as a beginner game.<br><br>
          It was October of 2021 when I drew the first sketches of some of the character for Mira's Journal.<br><br>
          The first characters I made for this game were Mira, Daze and Alcine.
          <br><br>
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyMira1.bmp" alt="The first sketch of Mira" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 60%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyMira2.bmp" alt="The first sketch of Mira but colored digitally" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 25%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Mira was a young wolf girl with some fire powers who ends up getting mixed up in Daze's affairs.<br><br>
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyGame3.bmp" alt="First sketch of Daze and Alcine, along with some UI elements" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 98%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Daze was meant to be a stereotypical hero, the usual leader of the party with a special destiny.<br><br>
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyAlcine.png" alt="Early sketch of Alcine" style="max-height: 200px; object-fit: scale-down; max-width: 25%;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyAlcineLater.png" alt="Later sketch of Alcine" style="max-height: 200px; object-fit: scale-down; max-width: 20%;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
          <img src="/media/MJ/EarlyAlcineLater2.bmp" alt="Sketch of alcine on top of Mira" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 22%; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br><br>
          Alcine has changed a lot through development. What's stayed the same is that they're a spirit creature with a liquid body.<br>
          But originally they had a more mature look with something that resembles long hair. But I later decided to make them more like a child originally that grows along the journey.<br><br>
          These are some other early sketches related to the game:<br><br>

        <h2>The RPG Maker MZ version of the game</h2>
        <p>
          In early 2022 I bought the RPG Maker MZ engine with the intention of using it to make this game.<br><br>
          The reason I picked it was simple:<br>
          I wanted to make a top down rpg that I thought was not too complex, and this seemed to be what this engine was designed for.<br><br>
          I worked on this version of the game for about 9 months, with some results.<br>
          However RPG Maker turned out to be quite limiting for what I wanted to do. <br><br>
          Working on a game on it feels more like modding an existing game rather than creating something new, as the pre-existing systems are designed for a very specific type of battle system. Creating mechanics and especially UI were pretty tedious, and working with plug-ins such as VizuStella was just annoying, so I ended up scrapping that version of the game.
          <br><br>
          Here are some screenshots of this version:
        </p>
        <img src="/media/MJ/RMScreenshot1.png" alt="The main menu did not look that fancy back then" style="max-height: 400px; width: 48%; max-width: 300px; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">
        <img src="/media/MJ/RMScreenshot2.png" alt="It's not supposed to be this zoomed out, there is a bug in the latest version of this that was never fixed." style="max-height: 400px; width: 48%; max-width: 300px; object-fit: scale-down;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);">

        <h2>The Godot version</h2>
        <p>
          After I was done with my entrance exams in the 15th of July 2023, I instantly jumped into this engine I had never used before called Godot.<br><br>
          Why Godot? There are Plenty of reasons.<br><br>
          One was the fact that it was open source, which comes with the usual benefits like being completly free and independent from a company's dumb decisions. <br>
          Open source software also often works great on Linux, which I had started using as my main operating system around that time. Godot had also just released the 4.0 update back then, so it felt like a great chance to jump in.<br><br>
          I had absolutely no programming knowlegde at the time, but I felt like it was a perfect chance to learn. <br><br>
          So I just started working on this game again and I slowly learned how to use most things in the engine. This time I had to implement stuff like saving and inventories myself, which I had taken for granted in RPG Maker, but it's honestly more fun this way.<br><br>
          And that brings us to the present, thanks for reading!

        </div>
        Mira is the most knowledgable of the party as well as the main damage dealer. However she struggles quite a bit in social situations and can let her emotions control her easily. <br>Trying to improve herself, she started keeping a personal journal, not knowing where that would lead her...<br><br>
        Being from a species whoose homeland is now gone, she lived in a small village along with other remaining Cyrenians.<br>
        She worked as a librarian in a nearby city.<br>She has an interest in science, magic and monsters, however she doesn't get many opportunities to use her theoretical knowledge.<br><br>

        </div>
        A strange spirit creature Mira found when first entering the Lost Realm. The player as Mira will have the option to name this character, but the canon name is Alcine.
        <br><br>Their body is made entirely out of water, that they control the shape and temperature of.<br>
        While not able to speak, Alcine behaves a lot like a young child and clings to Mira a lot since the day they met.<br><br>
        Alcine's origins are unknown, even to themself. But sometimes they have visions of another life, not always pleasant ones.<br><br>
        <h2>Asteria Versea</h2>
        <div style="display: flex; width: 100%; justify-content: left;">
          <img src="https://github.com/RaiHormo/Miras-Journal/blob/main/art/Renders/Asteria.png?raw=true" alt="Asteria Versea render" style="height: 300px; width: 300px; max-width: 50%; object-fit: cover; overflow: hidden; padding: 0;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br>

        </div>
        Asteria has been almost her entire life in the Lost Realm, seperated from the rest of the world. She adopted as a baby by a human named Feni Versea and raised around Pyrson. Being so isolated as a child, she didn't have many friends. One day, in the storage building in Pyrson, she saw a little ghost that sneaked in who introduced themself as Yaru. <br>Asteria and Yaru became friends, with Asteria growing more attached to the spirits in the Realm, leading her to become a summoner.<br><br>
        She can often put of a tough exterior but she often lacks confidence in her decisions, relying on the people around her a bit too much. She is also quite clueless about things, having grown up so isolated.
        <h2>Daze (David Zepher)</h2>
        <div style="display: flex; width: 100%; justify-content: left;">
          <img src="https://github.com/RaiHormo/Miras-Journal/blob/main/art/Renders/Daze.png?raw=true" alt="Daze render" style="height: 300px; width: 300px; max-width: 50%; object-fit: cover; overflow: hidden; padding: 0;" class="clickable-image" onclick="show_image(this);"><br>

        </div>
        Daze was told from a young age that he would need to be a hero.<br>The one who would free Iseferia from the corrupt Monarchy. Not only did that put a lot of pressure on him as a child but as the word got out that he is the chosen hero, he and his family were hunted to no end. Eventually he found a group of people that he could rely on and he aims to complete his set goal.<br>However after an incident he was seprated from his party and ended up with Mira in the Lost Realm, where he saved her from certain death.<br><br>
        Daze is calm and collected, in a way that might seem cold to some, but he is a caring person in reality. He speaks in a pretty formal way out of habit. Sometimes he might try to be more casual but it only end up making situations more awkward.

        As fast as a large scale game being worked on my a single person on their free time realistically can.<br><br>Eventually I want to have devlogs in this page, but for now you can join <a  style="color: #fdaa7b;" href="https://discord.gg/GcH9Du4bqw" target="_blank">my Discord server</a> where I talk about my work on the game as it happens.

      <div id="FAQ" class="MJ-tab">
        <h2>When will this be released?</h2>
        <p>I honestly have no idea. Game development is very complicated and I'm currently doing this myself entirely as a hobby. It'll probably take years.<br>
        Maybe some sort of demo release is closer, but don't hold your breath.
      </p>
      <h2>What platforms will it be available on?</h2>
      <p>
        Well the main target during development is Linux and Windows, with it releasing on Steam.<br>
        Mac is probably possible but I would have nothing to test it on. An android release is also something I would want to do after launch, but it would need a seprate UI mode for it to work.<br><br>
        Consoles? I wish I had the budget for that.
      </p>
      <h2>How will it release?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm still thinking about that, but I think the release will be split into the 3 in-game months: November, December and January.<br>
        These are the 3 major acts in the story, and I think focusing on one at a time will be less overwhelming.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the game being made with?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm using Godot as the game engine (The 4.x series and I keep it up-to-date).
        <br>For art I use Aseprite for pixelart and Krita for everything else.<br>
        Beyond that I use Obsidian for documentation and Audacity for audio editing, although I'm no audio expert.
      </p>
      <h2>Will more people join the team?</h2>
      <p>
        I do want to work with more people eventually.<br>
        I would definitely need someone to make music as I'm completly clueless in that area.<br>
        However I want to have a playable demo first so be sure the concept of the game works as I see it.
