# Iris' fancy website
My personal website

Includes a card layout style homepage, an art gallery and details about a bunch of the things I do.
It was created as an excuse to learn web development, and also to have my own place on the internet that isn't just a carrd page.

The design is mostly inspired by Google's Material Design 3, but there are a few other inspirations such as Metro, and just thing I think look good in general.
